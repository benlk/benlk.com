# A Custom Theme for Dropplets

This theme is a fork of [Jason Schuller][]'s `simple 1.0.1` theme that is packaged with [Dropplets][], incorporating some tweaks made by [Chris Reynolds][] when he was working on the theme for [chrisreynolds.io/blog/][]. 

Efforts have been made to attribute code where possible. 

`/style.css` is the original file distributed with Dropplets, and is copyright Circa75 Media, LLC. It is included here for ease of use. 

`/custom/style.css` is the modified stylesheet. It imports `/style.css`.
