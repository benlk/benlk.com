# A Custom Theme for Dropplets

This theme is a single-author fork of [Jason Schuller][]'s `simple 1.0.1` theme that is packaged with [Dropplets][], incorporating some code from [Simple Dark][] by [Chris Reynolds][].

## Features:

* Square post thumbnails
* Intro in a separately-styled <header> tag
* Square buttons
* No per-post author in posts list

Efforts have been made to attribute code where possible. 

`/custom/style.css` is the modified stylesheet, including some formatting taken from [Simple Dark][]
